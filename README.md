This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate various recursive algorithms. The programs include:

- **Descending Order**: Recursively displays numbers in descending order.
- **Ascending Order**: Recursively displays numbers in ascending order.
- **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Calculates the sum of natural numbers recursively.
- **Factorial**: Computes the factorial of a number using recursion.
- **Exponent**: Calculates the power of a base number raised to an exponent using recursion.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Computes the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

## How to Use

Each program is self-contained in its own package. You can run each program by navigating to the respective directory and executing the `main` method.
